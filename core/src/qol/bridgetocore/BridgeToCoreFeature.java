/**
 * Ported unchanged from the standalone Bridge To Core mod (github sonka / mindustry-bridge-to-core) -
 * only the packaging changed: it now implements {@link Feature} instead of {@code extends Mod}, its
 * toolbar became a {@link ToolbarWindow} (a {@link QolWindow}) instead of a bespoke draggable Table, and
 * both {@link #update()} and {@link #onLineConfirm()} additionally gate on {@link #isEnabled()} so the
 * hub's per-feature checkbox can turn the whole thing off.
 * <p>
 * Presses a hotkey to route a placement from the cursor to the nearest friendly core, pathfinding
 * around the player's own buildings. Which blocks get used depends on the mode picked on the
 * {@link ToolbarWindow}.
 * <p>
 * Bridge mode routes a chain of regular item bridges (bridge-conveyor). The final stretch next to
 * the core is built with inverted sorters instead of bridges, since bridges can only go straight
 * and can't usefully cover single-tile hops or turns. Only inverted sorters are used (never plain
 * sorters): with no item filter configured, a plain sorter always dumps cargo out its sides, while
 * an inverted sorter passes everything straight through in whatever direction it arrived from,
 * acting like an omnidirectional conveyor. Since that means it still can't perform an actual turn,
 * the search forbids changing direction once inside the final stretch.
 * <p>
 * Junction mode routes the whole way with single tile steps. While {@code ToolbarWindow.junctionBuildActive}
 * is on, that's junction for straight runs, an inverted sorter (lead-in) followed by a plain sorter (the
 * actual corner) for turns - junction isn't instant-transfer, so it gets the same throughput treatment
 * titanium mode uses rather than a single plain sorter per turn - with a minimum gap enforced between
 * turns, same as titanium mode, for the same reason. With the toggle off, the route is plain junction
 * tiles the whole way instead, turns included, and the turn-gap restriction doesn't apply either (nothing
 * to protect once no sorters are being placed). See {@link JunctionRouteFinder}.
 * <p>
 * Titanium conveyor mode also routes with single tile steps. A turn is an inverted sorter (lead-in)
 * followed by a plain sorter (the actual corner), dodging the usual conveyor-corner throughput hit;
 * straight runs cycle through repeating inverted-sorter pairs separated by a single conveyor tile
 * instead of solid conveyor. A minimum gap is enforced between turns, and the tile touching any
 * existing lead-in/corner always stays plain conveyor, so the pattern never chains 3+
 * instant-transfer tiles in a row. See {@link TitaniumRouteFinder}.
 * <p>
 * Independently of all three modes, the three build toggles on the {@link ToolbarWindow} rewrite a
 * block placed through the game's own normal placement UI (drag or click, anywhere - not just along a
 * routed path to the core) into the same optimized conveyor/sorter/inverted-sorter pattern - titanium,
 * regular conveyor, or junction all share {@link #applyLinePattern}, just a different block for the
 * straight runs. Junction-build uses the same lead-in-pair-turns-plus-cadence pattern {@link
 * JunctionRouteFinder}'s own pathfound route uses too (junction isn't an instant-transfer block, so both
 * the manual-drag and pathfound junction paths benefit from it, same as titanium/conveyor mode always
 * have) - the two are effectively mirrors of each other, not a deliberately different pattern, and it's
 * the SAME {@code junctionBuildActive} toggle that gates both halves of the mirror: on, both the
 * manual-drag rewrite and the pathfound route get the full sorter pattern; off, junction-build simply
 * doesn't fire at all (see {@link #onLineConfirm}) and {@link JunctionRouteFinder} leaves its route as
 * plain junction tiles too (see {@link JunctionRouteFinder#sortersEnabled}) - so the two stay mirrors in
 * both states, not just when the toggle happens to be on. See {@link #applyLinePattern}.

     * {@link #dirToRotation}, and writes it back to {@code p.rotation} - rather than trusting whatever
     * rotation the game's own line placement assigned. This used to just trust {@code p.rotation}
     * (reliable for titanium/plain conveyor, which do get correct per-tile "point toward next tile"
     * rotation from line placement), but junction turned out NOT to reliably get one (junction is one of
     * the few blocks with {@code rotate = false} - visually symmetric, a crossing point, so the game
     * never offers manual rotation for it - plausibly enough of an edge case in the placement-line
     * code's rotation computation to misfire). Computing geometrically instead is a pure
     * behavior-preserving swap for titanium/plain conveyor (a correctly-functioning engine assignment
     * and a geometric computation from the same known tile coordinates necessarily agree) and is what
     * makes this method safe to also call for junction. The LAST tile has no "next" tile within this run
     * to derive a direction from, so it's the one spot that still keeps the plan's own existing
     * rotation - the direction the line was heading.
     * <p>
     * The run's FIRST tile is always left a plain conveyor, unconditionally. It's the one tile
     * whose incoming feed this drag doesn't control - and that feed frequently doesn't exist yet:
     * the supply line gets built up to the belt's start later. An instant-transfer tile only passes
     * cargo straight through in whatever direction it arrived from, so a side feed built against
     * one later would push cargo out of the line entirely, where a plain conveyor accepts a feed
     * from any side and turns it down the line. (Accepted price: the seam where one drag continues
     * another can show two conveyors back to back - the previous drag's ...C-I-I-C tail cadence
     * meeting this rule's mandatory C.)
     * <p>
     * Two turns on adjacent tiles - every step of a shallow-angle diagonal drag is one - are their
     * own special corner shape: the two corner sorters ARE a legal instant-transfer pair all by
     * themselves, so the lead-in pass must NOT prepend an inverted sorter (that would form a
     * 3-chain and bait the defensive sweep into degrading the second corner into a conveyor, which
     * is exactly how shallow diagonals used to end up with 2-3 conveyors bunched together). The
     * double corner comes out ...C-S-S-C..., padded by the neighboring stretches' mandatory
     * boundary conveyors.
     * <p>
     * Also checks the actual tile just past each end of this run - a previous, already-processed
     * drag's build plan, or an already-built structure - and treats an instant-transfer block
     * sitting there exactly like an in-run turn boundary, so continuing a belt across multiple
     * separate drags never chains a 3rd instant-transfer tile onto whatever the previous drag

     * another bridge; a 1-tile bridge step just relies on the plain forward dump between two
     * adjacent bridges, no actual link needed). An inverted sorter can't actually turn cargo (it
     * only continues whatever direction the cargo arrived from), so once a node is inside the final
     * stretch, the search is no longer allowed to change direction - the turn has to happen earlier,
     * out in the bridge zone. This particular ban is a hard physical fact and always applies,
     * regardless of `forbidTurns` below.
     * <p>
     * `forbidTurns`, when on, extends that same hard ban out to the min-turn-distance setting - much
     * farther than the final stretch alone. A single-bend path's corner sits at one of exactly two
     * fixed spots determined by cursor/core geometry, so the soft, distance-scaled {@link
     * #turnPenalty} can only pick which of those two spots to use - it can't pull the corner away from
     * the core if that's where the fixed spot happens to be; only a hard rule that forces an actual
     * multi-turn detour can. See {@link #connectAtCursor} for the two-pass strict-then-permissive
     * fallback that uses this without ever turning a merely-inconvenient corner into an outright
     * "no path found".

     * A* search for junction mode: every step is a single tile, either continuing the current
     * direction (junction) or turning. A turn is two tiles, not one: an inverted sorter (the "lead-in",
     * still on the incoming straight leg) immediately followed by a plain sorter (the actual corner) -
     * same shape {@link TitaniumRouteFinder} uses, and for the same reason: junction is NOT
     * instant-transfer (unlike sorter/inverted sorter), so a plain junction corner would be a throughput
     * bottleneck the same way a plain conveyor corner is, and routing the turn through the two sorter
     * variants instead avoids it. The lead-in's only job is passing cargo straight through regardless of
     * which side it arrived from, so the corner always receives from a consistent, known side.
     * <p>
     * Straight runs cycle through repeating inverted-sorter pairs separated by a single junction tile,
     * instead of solid junction, for the same throughput reason - see {@link #reconstruct}. {@link
     * #MIN_TURN_GAP} enforces a minimum distance between turns (checked in {@link #canTurnHere}), same
     * value and reasoning as {@link TitaniumRouteFinder#MIN_TURN_GAP}: a turn occupies 2 instant-transfer
     * tiles, so a gap of 3 guarantees at least 1 plain junction tile separates any two turns, keeping any
     * run of instant-transfer tiles at 2 long, never the 3+ Mindustry refuses to carry cargo through.
     * <p>
     * A distance-scaled penalty is added to a turn's own cost - see {@link #singleTileTurnPenalty} -
     * turning near the core costs much more than turning far away, so bends get pushed toward happening
     * early, out where there's room to route around obstacles, rather than right on the core's doorstep.
     * `forbidTurns`, when on, goes further and rejects a turn outright within the min-turn-distance
     * setting of the core - a single-bend path's corner sits at one of exactly two fixed spots determined
     * by cursor/core geometry, so a soft penalty alone can't move it away from the core if that's where
     * it happens to land; only a hard rule forcing an actual detour can. See {@link
     * #connectJunctionAtCursor} for the two-pass strict-then-permissive fallback that uses this without
     * ever turning a merely-inconvenient corner into an outright "no path found".
     * <p>
     * All of the above (turn sorters, their lead-ins, straight-run cadence, and the {@link #MIN_TURN_GAP}
     * search constraint that exists only to protect that pattern from self-chaining) is gated behind
     * {@link #sortersEnabled}, a snapshot of {@link ToolbarWindow#junctionBuildActive} taken at search
     * time: with the toggle off, the route is plain junction tiles the whole way, turns included - no
     * sorters, no lead-ins, no cadence, and no turn-spacing restriction on the search either, since
     * nothing is being chained anymore. Toggle on = the full throughput-optimized pattern described
     * above.

     * A* search for titanium conveyor mode. Single-tile steps the whole way, titanium conveyor for
     * straight runs. A turn is two tiles, not one: an inverted sorter (the "lead-in", still on the
     * incoming straight leg) immediately followed by a plain sorter (the actual corner) - not letting
     * plain conveyor handle the turn itself, even though it could, because conveyor corners are a
     * well-known belt throughput bottleneck in Mindustry, and neither sorter variant has one (both are
     * "instant transfer"). The lead-in's only job is passing cargo straight through regardless of
     * which side it arrived from (that's what an unconfigured inverted sorter does), so the corner
     * always receives from a consistent, known side; the corner itself is a plain, unconfigured sorter
     * that dumps to the correct perpendicular side to make the actual 90-degree turn.
     * <p>
     * Two instant-transfer tiles in a row (lead-in + corner) is fine - Mindustry only refuses to chain
     * *three* instant-transfer blocks in a row, checked from the receiving tile's own perspective
     * (its immediate source and its own chosen target can't both be instant, or it refuses to pass the
     * item at all). The danger is two turns ending up close enough together that their lead-in/corner
     * pairs touch, forming a run of 3+ instant tiles with no plain conveyor gap - that's exactly what
     * broke silently in an earlier version of this mode. {@link #MIN_TURN_GAP} enforces a minimum
     * distance between turns (checked in {@link #canTurnHere}) so that never happens: by the time a
     * new turn is considered, at least one plain conveyor tile is guaranteed to separate it from the
     * previous one.
     * <p>
     * `forbidTurns`, when on, rejects a turn outright within the min-turn-distance setting of the core -
     * on top of the soft, distance-scaled {@link #singleTileTurnPenalty}. A single-bend path's corner
     * sits at one of exactly two fixed spots determined by cursor/core geometry, so no matter how steep
     * the soft penalty curve is, it can only pick which of those two spots to use - it can't pull the
     * corner away from the core if that's where the fixed spot happens to be. Only a hard rule that
     * forces an actual multi-turn detour can. See {@link #connectTitaniumAtCursor} for the two-pass
     * strict-then-permissive fallback that uses this without ever turning a merely-inconvenient corner
     * into an outright "no path found".
