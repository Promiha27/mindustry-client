/**
 * Two triggers, same handoff underneath: hold Shift and left-click while a schematic is previewed at the
 * cursor (same gesture surface as {@link qol.forcebuildschematic.ForceBuildSchematicFeature}'s Ctrl-click,
 * deliberately a different modifier so the two don't collide) - OR hold Shift while placing/dragging a
 * normal line of blocks by hand (a conveyor belt, a run of nodes, anything). Either way, the freshly
 * queued blocks get pushed into the team's shared rebuild queue ({@code team.data().plans}, the same
 * {@code Queue<BlockPlan>} vanilla itself feeds when one of your buildings is destroyed, for
 * rebuild-command units to fix later) and PART of the currently assist-commanded helpers get switched over
 * to the vanilla "Rebuild" command, scaled to how many blocks there are.
 * <p>
 * Engine fact ({@code BuilderAI.updateMovement}): on the plain (non-assist) Rebuild command, a unit with
 * no current build plan and nobody to follow pulls its next block straight off {@code team.data().plans}
 * on its own timer ({@code rebuildPeriod}) - entirely independent of any player being present or actively
 * building. "Assist" mode instead needs SOMEONE on the team actively building right now to follow, which
 * is exactly the participation sonka wanted to drop. Pushing plans into the shared queue and handing units
 * the Rebuild command is therefore all it takes for them to keep building completely on their own
 * afterwards - the actual "build without me" work is just vanilla {@code BuilderAI}'s existing Rebuild
 * loop; this feature's own job is the initial hand-off plus noticing when it's done (see below).
 * <p>
 * The hand-drag path listens for {@link LineConfirmEvent} - fired right after the game commits a line
 * placement (drag OR single click) to the player's own build queue (see {@code
 * qol.bridgetocore.BridgeToCoreFeature}'s {@code onLineConfirm}, same event, same "diff against a synced
 * known-plans identity set" idiom, copied from there since it already solved this exact "which plans are
 * new" problem). Fresh plans are then REMOVED from the player's own queue (they're being handed to helpers
 * instead of built personally) via {@code Queue.remove(T)} - {@code BuildPlan} has no {@code equals}
 * override, so this is identity removal, exactly what's needed. {@code knownPlans} is resynced every tick
 * (not just inside the event handler) for the same reason {@code BridgeToCoreFeature} does it: so a plan
 * added some other way (schematic paste, drag-moving an existing plan) is already "known" by the time the
 * next real line commit fires, and doesn't get mistaken for part of it.
 * <p>
 * Registration-order note: {@code BridgeToCoreFeature} registers its own {@link LineConfirmEvent} listener
 * before this feature does (earlier in {@code QolSuiteMod}'s feature list), so if its titanium/conveyor/
 * junction build-toggle rewrote a freshly-dragged conveyor run into a sorter/inverted-sorter pattern before
 * this listener runs, this feature dispatches helpers to build THAT final pattern, not the original plain
 * line - which is what you'd want, not a bug, but worth knowing if the two ever need to be decoupled.
 * <p>
 * Candidates are ranked by an optional configurable TYPE priority first (see {@link #showConfigDialog}),
 * then by distance to the plan-center within the same rank - sonka's ask: slow ground types (a mech like
 * Nova) are good auto-build labor since they don't need to keep pace with a moving player anyway, while
 * fast types (Poly) are worth keeping on Assist so they can actually follow you around. Types not listed
 * rank last (least preferred for auto-build, most likely to stay on Assist) - an empty/unset priority list
 * (the default) falls back to pure distance sorting, unchanged from before this existed. Only
 * {@code Math.ceil(blockCount / autobuild-blocks-per-helper)} of the ranked candidates (clamped to how many
 * are actually available) get redirected, not the whole assist pool.
 * <p>
 * Completion tracking: the exact (x, y, block) targets queued are remembered in {@link #pendingTargets},
 * checked every {@link #CHECK_INTERVAL_TICKS} against the live world (a target is done once that tile
 * actually holds the right block) rather than trying to watch {@code team.data().plans} itself - that
 * queue only pops a finished entry lazily, the next time SOME unit happens to re-examine its head, so it
 * can't be trusted as a live "still pending" signal. Once every target is confirmed built, every unit this
 * feature redirected ({@link #managedUnits}) that's STILL on Rebuild (not manually re-commanded since) gets
 * switched back to Assist in one batch.
 * <p>
 * <b>Real multiplayer (connecting to someone else's server) can't do any of the above.</b> {@code
 * team.data().plans} is a plain object field with no accompanying {@code Call.*} RPC to remotely add to
 * it - unlike a mutation on a self-hosted game (client and server are the SAME objects there), a networked
 * client's {@code player.team().data()} is only a locally-rendered shadow copy fed by server snapshots;
 * writing to it has zero effect on the server's own authoritative `TeamData`, so Rebuild-commanded units
 * on the real server would just find that queue perpetually empty. Checked the full {@code Call} RPC list
 * (`mindustry.gen.Call`, generated from `@Remote`-annotated methods) for anything resembling "queue a plan
 * for another unit" - the only build-plan-related RPC is {@code clientPlanSnapshot}, which syncs the
 * PLAYER'S OWN currently-controlled unit's queue automatically (that's how `player.unit().addBuild(...)`
 * already gets to the server safely, e.g. in {@code ForceBuildSchematicFeature}/{@code
 * ConveyorUpgradeFeature}) - there's no equivalent for arbitrary other units. So on a real server ({@link
 * mindustry.net.Net#client()} true), this feature does nothing beyond what a plain click/drag already
 * does - Shift is simply ignored there rather than pretending to redirect helpers that would never
 * actually receive anything.
