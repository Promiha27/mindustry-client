/**
 * Splits assist-commanded helper units between the team's builder players and makes each one STICK
 * to its player, instead of the whole swarm chasing whoever touched a blueprint last.
 * <p>
 * Why they chase (vanilla BuilderAI, assist mode): every 20 ticks the unit re-picks
 * {@code assistFollowing} = the player physically CLOSEST to the unit, and a second scan follows
 * ANY actively-building team unit within ~187 tiles - so when your teammate places a block across
 * the base, every idle helper on the team charges over there. The one lever a client has is unit
 * POSITION: the closest-player pick means a unit parked at its player's side follows that player
 * whenever they build. So this feature keeps each helper parked near its assigned player between
 * builds (plain move command - no BuilderAI, no chasing), and hands the assist command back the
 * moment the player is building. Everything runs over the same command RPCs the vanilla UI uses.
 * <p>
 * Units are divided evenly and assignments are sticky - rebalancing (players joining/leaving,
 * helpers dying or being produced) moves only the shortfall, preferring the units nearest the
 * player that needs them. Re-commanding a helper manually takes it out of the system (sync-grace
 * detection, as everywhere in this mod). With fewer than two builder players present the feature
 * stands down entirely and releases its units back to plain vanilla assist.
 * <p>
 * Coordination: managed units are claimed via {@link UnitClaims} so core-heal won't draft them
 * mid-park - EXCEPT poly-split's diverted polys, whose claim is owned by
 * {@link MineDefaultsFeature}; those are managed "borrowed" (no claim of our own, dropped the
 * instant poly-split takes them back to mining), and poly-split in turn treats a unit this feature
 * parked on move as still-assisting (see {@link #managedExpected}).
 * <p>
 * ONLY ONE player on a team should run this feature - two mods managing the same team units would
 * fight each other's commands (each sees the other's RPCs as "manual" overrides).
