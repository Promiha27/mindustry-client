/**
 * A settings-screen row that's just a button opening a dialog (e.g. "configure watched units"), for
 * when a feature needs more than checkPref/sliderPref can express. Registering it through
 * {@link SettingsTable#pref} - the same mechanism {@code checkPref}/{@code sliderPref} use internally -
 * is what actually matters here: a plain {@code table.button(...)} call from a category's builder
 * callback isn't tracked in the table's own {@code Setting} list, and the settings screen detects that
 * mismatch and disables its search bar for the whole category ("Mod added an unexpected row to
 * SettingsTable") - the exact bug this mod hit and fixed elsewhere for its section headers.
